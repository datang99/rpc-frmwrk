**Introduction of the Examples:**

* [`smoketest`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/smoketest): the smoke test of this framework.

* [`helloworld`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/helloworld): To demonstrate the helloworld example as the start-point for a
    new development. It shows how to setup proxy/server, send a call from the
    client side and how to service a call on the server side and return the
    responses.

* [`asynctst`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/asynctst): 'asynchronous test', an example to demonstrate how to call remote
    procedure asynchronously and how to service a remote call asynchronously

* [`evtest`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/evtest): 'event test', an example to demonstrate how to send a event/signal
    from server side and how to handle a signal or event from client side

* [`actcancel`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/actcancel): 'actively canceling test', an example to demonstrate how to cancel an
    ongoing request from client side actively.

* [`inproc`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/inproc): 'In-Process test', an example to demonstrate how the server and
    client work on the different threads of the same process.

* [`katest`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/katest): To demonstrate the keep-alive heartbeat between the proxy and
    server.

* [`prtest`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/prtest): To demonstrate how to pause/resume of a interface and the interface
    response in both states.

* [`stmtest`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/stmtest): To demonstrate the basic chatting function with the local/remote 
    streaming support.

* [`sftest`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/sftest): To demonstrate a simple file-server with the local/remote streaming
    support.
* [`btinrt`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/btinrt) : To demonstrate a deployment approach with built-in router support,
    and the performance improvement.
