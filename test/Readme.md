**Introduction of the Examples:**

* `smoketest`: the smoke test of this framework.

* `helloworld`: To demonstrate the helloworld example as the start-point for a
    new development. It shows how to setup proxy/server, send a call from the
    client side and how to service a call on the server side and return the
    responses.

* `asynctst`: 'asynchronous test', an example to demonstrate how to call remote

* `katest`: To demonstrate the keep-alive heartbeat between the proxy and
    server.

* `prtest`: To demonstrate how to pause/resume of a interface and the interface
    response in both states.

* `stmtest`: To demonstrate the basic chatting function with the local/remote 
    streaming support.

* `sftest`: To demonstrate a simple file-server with the local/remote streaming
    support.
* `btinrt` : To demonstrate a deployment approach with built-in router support,
    and the performance improvement.
