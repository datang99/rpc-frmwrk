UploadFile/DownloadFile test. 
1. test if local/remote UploadFile works 
2. test if local/remote DownloadFile works
3. test if the multi-interface mechanism works. So far, the CSimpFileServer has
4 interfaces include CMyFileServer, IInterfaceServer, CStatCountersServer, IStream, and
CEchoServer.
NOTE that, this is an advanced application of the rpc-framework. Unlike other tests, it requires a lot of internal knowlege.
