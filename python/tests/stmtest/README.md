### This is a test with the streaming API.
The test case is similiar to a chat application. The test case send a small message to the server,   
and the server response with a message counter. The two are talking in a ping-pong fashion. It is   
almost the same as the C++ version of test case [`stmtest`](https://github.com/zhiming99/rpc-frmwrk/tree/master/test/stmtest)   

BTW, this test case share the same description with its C++ cousin.
