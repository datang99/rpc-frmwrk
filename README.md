# rpc-frmwrk
An effort for embedded RPC framework, and hope it could find its usage in IOT or other embedded systems.

## Dependency:  
This framework depends on the following packags:  
1. `glib-2.0`  
2. `dbus-1.0`  
3. `libjson-cpp`  
4. `libdbus-glib-1`  
  
I will soon replace the glib with `libev` to reduce the resource footprint on the target system.
