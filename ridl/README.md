### Introduction   
The `ridl`, stands for `rpc idl`, as the RPC interface description language. And this project tries to deliver a rapid development tool for `rpc-frmwrk` by generating the set of skelton source files for proxy/server , as well as the configuration files, and Makefile with the input `ridl` files. It is expected be able to generate the skelton project for C++, Python and Java.
This tool is a convenient approach to focus development effort on your business implementations. But you can still refer to the `../test` directory to manually craft an `rpc-frmwrk` applications, with the maximum flexibility and performance advantage.
