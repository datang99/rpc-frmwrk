**Introductions**
* This directory contains the typical examples that would be useful in distributed application development.
* The implementations of the examples are grouped in different languages, Java, Python and C++.
* The files listed of each example are only files manually changed from its auto-generated version. Run the `ridlc` to generate the complete set of files of the example.
